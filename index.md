### CPSC 120

* Lab 4

    Lab 4, part 2 was a favorite because I wanted to see first hand the flow chart of editing and compiling code as well as preforming a black box to esnure that the code is bug free. It was interesting to trouble shoot any issues I faced as well. I learned numerous thngs from the lab including how to troubleshoot and I liked seeing the feedback from making any errors

  Lab 7

    Lab 7 part 2 was so interesting due to the fact that I have cousins who play it every weekend and I never really got into it but they would play for moey and it was so intesne seeing them go at it. So writing functions and learning how it works and making those calculations for the value of a Blackjack was an incredible learning experience.

  Lab 9
    
    Lab 9 part 1 this lab was not that bad I wrote code that built vectors and what I liked about it was it built my understanding on identifying lines of code and writing function definitions. This will benefit me as now I am more diversified in my understanding of code and it was an intriguing lab to do as I was faced with issues to overcome and learn from.
